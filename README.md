Just for fun Marvel API consumer app. 

###Demo

http://marvelous-world.herokuapp.com/


###Usage

Nothing much!. It just like ordinary rest client but here we go, the basic url form to search marvel superhero by name

    http://[url]/superhero/[name]

for example to search `x-23` (superhot! :smile:) type like this

	http://localhost:5000/superhero/x-23

or with heroku demo for `wolverine` you will type

	http://marvelous-world.herokuapp.com/superhero/wolverine
